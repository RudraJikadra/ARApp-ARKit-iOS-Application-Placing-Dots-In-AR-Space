# ARApp-ARKit-iOS-Application-Placing-Dots-In-AR-Space
Augmented Reality iOS Project using Apple's AR Kit for placing Spheres(Dots) wherever user taps.
When the application starts the camera will begin and when user taps anywhere in the environment he is in, a dot will be placed in that position in 3D Space using AR Kit.
It will stay there itself and the tracking is so insanely great thanks to apple's ARKit which is amazing.
